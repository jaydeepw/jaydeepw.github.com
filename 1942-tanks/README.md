A simple HTML5 game build by me in 2011 to learn programming in JavaScript. It uses HTML5 Canvas. It is not very advanced. Just putting out here so anyone can clone and extend it.

I dont have plans to work on this game anymore as it was just for the learning purpose.
However, you can clone this game, add features, fix issues and release as your own game
as long as your work abides by the MIT license terms and conditions given in this repo.

## Setup
- Clone the repository or alternative download it
- Launch `Main.html` in the browser
